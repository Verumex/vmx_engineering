# VmX Engineering Portal

Welcome to the VmX Engineering portal source. The purpose of this simple Gatsby
site is primarily to share information about our engineering team, culture and
practices. You may also stumble upon Easter eggs and experiments as this serves
as one of our team's creative outlets in addition to being an information hub.
You've been warned! üêâ

```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.

## üîß Configure

Write markdown files in `content` folder.

Open `config.js` for templating variables.

- `gatsby` config for global configuration:
    - `pathPrefix` - Gatsby Path Prefix
    - `siteUrl` - Gatsby Site URL
    - `gaTrackingId` - Google Analytics Tracking ID

- `header` config for site header configuration:
    - `title` - The title that appears on the top left
    - `githubUrl` - The Github URL for the docs website
    - `helpUrl` - Help URL for pointing to resources
    - `tweetText` - Tweet text
    - `links` - Links on the top right
    - `search` - Enable search and [configure Algolia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/)

- `sidebar` config for navigation links configuration
    - `forcedNavOrder` for left sidebar navigation order. It should be in the format "/<filename>"
    - `frontLine` - whether to show a front line at the beginning of a nested menu.(Collapsing capability would be turned of if this option is set to true)
    - `links` - Links on the bottom left of the sidebar
    - `ignoreIndex` - Set this to true if the index.md file shouldn't appear on the left sidebar navigation. Typically this can be used for landing pages.

- `siteMetadata` config for website related configuration
    - `title` - Title of the website
    - `description` - Description of the website
    - `ogImage` - Social Media share og:image tag
    - `docsLocation` - The Github URL for Edit on Github

- For sub nesting in left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename and the sub navigation is auto-generated. The sub navigation is alphabetically ordered.

## Live Code Editor

To render react components for live editing, add the `react-live=true` to the code section. For example:

```javascript react-live=true
<button>Edit my text</button>
```

In the above code, just add `javascript react-live=true` after the triple quote ``` to start rendering react components that can be edited by users.

## ü§ñ SEO friendly

This is a static site and comes with all the SEO benefits. Configure meta tags like title and description for each markdown file using MDX Frontmatter

```markdown
---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
metaDescription: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs are generated automatically.
