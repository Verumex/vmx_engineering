## What's the Opportunity Like?

Being a fintech business, engineering at VmX is critical to the success of
our company.

Joining our team as a Junior Rails Engineer is a unique opportunity for a
bright, driven developer to grow alongside an experienced team of software
engineers. You'll be responsible for the full software development life cycle,
building features across our whole stack. Your contributions will be
continuously deployed and used by the world's largest real estate investors.

But not to worry, we'll start you off slow. Our emphasis will be on your
accelerated learning and growth. You'll be part of a high-functioning team
that is here to help wherever we can. Our company is growing fast and so will
you.
