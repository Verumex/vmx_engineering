## What's the Opportunity Like?

Being a fintech business, engineering at VmX is critical to the success of
our company.

Joining our team as an Engineering Lead is a unique opportunity for an
experienced technology leader to leave their mark by solving complex problems
on a daily basis and maintaining a high-performance team of developers.
You'll be responsible for hiring, managing and guiding our engineers in Chennai,
which will include everything from nuts and bolts development to architectural
decision-making, code reviews and motivational support.

You'll report directly to our US-based CTO and/or VP of Engineering, and
ultimately be responsible for the performance of the software development team
in India. You'll also work and coordinate with our technical leadership in
Bangkok, Thailand. Your communication skills across languages and cultures
should rival your technical abilities if you are to be successful in this role.
