## What's the Opportunity Like?

Being a fintech business, engineering at VmX is critical to the success of
our company.

Joining our team as a Senior Rails Engineer is a unique opportunity for an
experienced problem solver and technologist to leave their mark by
solving complex problems on a daily basis and creating new solutions in a
complex domain. You'll be responsible for the full software development life
cycle from conception and design to deployment, delivering high-quality and
architecturally sound systems.

You'll be responsible for designing and implementing client-side and
server-side architecture, as well API's and integrations that address our
business needs. You'll also be involved in scaling, monitoring, and optimizing
system performance. Your contributions will be continuously deployed and used
by the world's largest real estate investors.

As part of a high-functioning team you'll have access to the engineering teams
in all three of our offices (Bangkok, India and the US), and we're always
available to help—internal skill-building is a core competency at VmX. Our
company is growing fast and so will you.
