metaTitle: "VmX Engineering | Our Team"
---

Our company is a hybrid of software engineering and finance/investment
expertise. Although our backgrounds and responsibilities vary wildly, we’re
a tight-knit bunch that loves cross-pollination. And while our mission is big,
we try to keep things light. We provide a happy, productive workplace, and
we’re constantly improving it! A good sense of humor goes a long way on
this team.

## Software Development

The core of our product team is software development (we are, after all, a
technology company). The core of our development team came from leadership
positions at Lockstep Labs, a boutique software agency specializing in financial
services technology that was acquired by VmX in 2018. We plan on maintaining
a small, high-caliber team (<30 developers) for the foreseeable future, so you
won't find us filling seats to pad numbers. We invest a lot in our team
members and expect the same in return, so we're highly selective in our
recruiting process.

Here are the types of things we look for and expect in our team members—let
us know if you find yourself nodding along:

- _You are Language/Tool Agnostic_ - You are fluent in the general
  principles of web-based software, as well as at least one contemporary server
  framework (preferably Ruby on Rails), but you should also be comfortable with
  the fact that we like to choose the right tool for the job. Familiarity with
  client-side frameworks like ReactJS is advantageous as we'll regularly hop from
  controller logic to TSX if the feature demands it. We don't strongly specialize
  between back-end and front-end development, though team members frequently lean
  one way or the other.
- _You’re a Builder_ - You have called yourself a hacker/dev/engineer for
  4+ years, during which you’ve produced high quality software, quickly and
  efficiently. Junior developer roles are scarce at VmX, most of us have a number
  of years behind us.
- _You Know What You’re Doing_ – You should be excited to work on a
  high-powered team, be challenged, and do the best work of your career. There
  isn't a lot of hand-holding so a high level of competence and craftsmanship are
  considered table stakes.
- _You care about security_ - At VmX we deal with a significant amount of
  sensitive data, and maintain a robust security posture. We expect you to
  consider the security implications of every line of code.
- _Maybe You like Finance a Lot_ - We are steeped in financial terminology
  as a matter of course and have developed intuitions around the needs of our
  clients. Some background (or interest) in fintech and building systems to
  support transactions at scale will be incredibly useful.
- _You have a Team Ethos_ - You thrive in a creative, inventive, fast-paced
  startup environment, with people who are passionate about their work and
  mission. You’re not just excited to work cross-functionally, you demand it,
  and you won’t be daunted whether you wind up in SQL or an ERB file.
- _You’re Flexible, a Quick Responder_ - The problems we’re trying to solve as
  an organization are dynamic and each day brings fresh challenges. You can
  react quickly and efficiently when called upon to change or pivot, and you
  aren’t emotionally attached to yesterday’s feature set.
- _You Believe That No Problem is Too Hard_ - In an industry where people are
  constantly “stuck”, you find ways to get it done. You know how to articulate
  and roll out solutions, recognizing there are many solutions to the same
  problem. You find new and effective ways to streamline and create processes
  to increase efficiency.
- _You Crave Feedback/Input_ – As a team we are opinionated but humble. We
  provide lots of feedback on PRs, so if you are overly attached to your
  implementation or easily offended by code critiques, you’ll find our
  collaborative approach draining.
- _You Follow TDD and are Picky_ – We care deeply about writing maintainable,
  extensible and resilient code. That means test coverage against regressions
  and adherence to linter-enforced syntax. Extra spaces at the end of lines drive
  you nuts.
- _You Are a Self Starter_ – We are all in the weeds together, there won’t be
  a Product Manager babysitting your work and assigning tickets. We rely on
  [Loud Productivity](https://github.com/lockstep/playbook#product-management)
  to communicate progress with our team members, and expect you to
  determine the best use of your own time.
- _You Can Work Remotely_ – The VmX team is “remote but co-located”. The team
  is distributed around the world with offices in India, Thailand, Norway and
  the US. Everyone is working with someone, but no one is working with everyone.
  Your engineering colleagues will not be nearby, so this relative “tech
  isolation” can’t be a de-motivator for you.

## Design

At VmX design is a core feature, not a "nice to have". All of our client-facing
UX is crisp, highly polished and well-received by all of our clients. We are
actively looking for a designer to join our team and help extend this design
prowess into the next generation of features and our internal-facing
functionality.

## Data Analysis

We plan to build out a data science arm at VmX to complement our software team,
and are having early conversations with individuals well versed in machine
learning and AI as it can be applied to our wealth of commercial real estate
data. From lease abstracting to comp trend analysis, VmX generates hundreds of
useful data streams. Our early data team will have a field day digging into
our databases, so if applied data science is your thing please get in touch!
