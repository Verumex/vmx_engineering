At VmX we take the concept of convention over configuration seriously, and
double down on industry and community best practices in ways that can
occasionally feel dogmatic. However, convention is the backbone of both our
scalability and security strategies (with respect to both our code base and our
team), so deviations from the norm are generally discouraged.

That said, some conventions aren't as widely adopted as others and
some highly productive design patterns need to get more love than they
frequently do. We are devoting a section of this site to patterns and code
strategies that we find particularly useful and either aren't or can't be
disseminated widely enough.

NOTE: Most of these patterns are Ruby or Rails implementations, so if reviewing
ruby code snippets isn't your thing you may want to skip this section.
